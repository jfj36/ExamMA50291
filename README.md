# Test Solution. 

## Declaration of the use of copilot. 
 
I, (Student number: 239716451), used Microsoft Copilot to assist in solving this test. I leveraged Copilot's guidance to generate the code and write the function descriptions for each problem. Additionally, I reviewed and modified the outcomes generated by Copilot to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## General modifications

Three files are added to the repo before starting to solve the test: 
- A directory called `outputs` to store the results of the code.
- README.md document containing some explanations of the code
- A jupyter notebook called Trial_error_notebook.ipynb to chech the performance of the code. 

## Solutions 

1)  Modify the package or the file "test0_cm.py" (not both), to make "test0_cm.py" run successfully. 

The change I made on test0_cm.py was calling the define_dataframe_structure function from the cluster_maker module and printing its documentation string using the __doc__ attribute.


2) Modify the package or the file "test1_cm.py" (not both), to make 
 "test1_cm.py" run successfully.

 I changed the function define_dataframe_structure() in the package cluster_maker/dataframe_builder.py. The change was this:
    - max_length = max(max_length, len(spec.get('reps', [])-0)+1)
    + max_length = max(max_length, len(spec.get('reps', [])))
