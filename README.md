# Test Solution. 

## Declaration of the use of copilot. 
 
I, (Student number: 239716451), used Microsoft Copilot to assist in solving this test. I leveraged Copilot's guidance to generate the code and write the function descriptions for each problem. Additionally, I reviewed and modified the outcomes generated by Copilot to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## General modifications

Three files are added to the repo before starting to solve the test: 
- A directory called `outputs` to store the results of the code.
- README.md document containing some explanations of the code
- A jupyter notebook called Trial_error_notebook.ipynb to chech the performance of the code.
