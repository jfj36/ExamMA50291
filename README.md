# Test Solution. 

## Declaration of the use of copilot. 
 
I, (Student number: 239716451), used Microsoft Copilot to assist in solving this test. I leveraged Copilot's guidance to generate the code and write the function descriptions for each problem. Additionally, I reviewed and modified the outcomes generated by Copilot to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## General modifications

Three files are added to the repo before starting to solve the test: 
- A directory called `outputs` to store the results of the code.
- README.md document containing some explanations of the code
- A jupyter notebook called Trial_error_notebook.ipynb to chech the performance of the code. 

## Solutions 

1)  Modify the package or the file "test0_cm.py" (not both), to make "test0_cm.py" run successfully. 

The change I made on test0_cm.py was calling the define_dataframe_structure function from the cluster_maker module and printing its documentation string using the __doc__ attribute.


2) Modify the package or the file "test1_cm.py" (not both), to make 
 "test1_cm.py" run successfully.

 I changed the function define_dataframe_structure() in the package cluster_maker/dataframe_builder.py. The change was this:
    - max_length = max(max_length, len(spec.get('reps', [])-0)+1)
    + max_length = max(max_length, len(spec.get('reps', [])))

3) Try and understand what the functions in module "data_analyser.py" do and write an appropriate, human-readable, docstring for each one of them.

There are two function in data_analyser.py. 

- calculate_correlation(data) : Calculates the correlation matrix for the given data.
- calculate_descriptive_statistics(): Calculate descriptive statistics for the given data. The descritive statistics include count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum values for each column of the data 
    includes 
    - Count
    - Mean 
    - Standard deviation 
    - Minimum value
    - 25th percentile
    - Median or 50th percentile
    - 75th percentile
    - Maximum value
    - Number of missing values in each column.
